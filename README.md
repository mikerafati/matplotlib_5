# The Power of Plots
The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, i decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of my own. In my latest capacity, i will be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, i will be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

since  i been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

 objective is to build a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

As final considerations:

* i used the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.
* used the Matplotlib library.
* include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* proper labeling of the plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.
